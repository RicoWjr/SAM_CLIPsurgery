# SAM + CLIP surgery

**Note**: This project was created at the end of 2022, when **SAM** had just been proposed, but the **"text"** was not used as a **guide** to segment objects with specific semantics. This project aims to combine **_CLIP surgery_**, a great explainable work by HKUST, with SAM to achieve understanding and segmentation of objects with only a text input.
