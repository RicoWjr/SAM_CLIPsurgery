# SAM_CLIPsurgery
SAM + CLIPsurgery

**Note**: This project was created at the end of 2022, when **SAM** had just been proposed, but the **"point"** was not used as a **guide** to segment objects at specific locations. This project aims to combine *CLIPsurgery*, an explainable work by HKUST, with SAM to achieve understanding and segmentation of objects at user-specified locations.
